QMAST Sailcode
##############

Set your Arduino sketchbook directory to be the directory within this
repository called "sketchbook", cause you know, names.

I'm not changing the name of the repository from Sailcode, but I have changed
the main sketch name to "ferrycode". As we move on through the project, we
will change the name whenever we make a big breakthrough.
